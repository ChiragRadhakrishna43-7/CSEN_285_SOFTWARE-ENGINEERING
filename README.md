  <b><u>REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT</u></b><br/>
  <b> 1.0 Overview </b><br/>
  Tony Carrasco is the President of Orange Computer. Orange Computer was founded in 2010 with the help of his three friends. Tony was the genius behind the technology that Orange used. Orange manufactured small personal computers which were user friendly.<br/><br/>
  Tony designed a small system to record sales and profits. In the first five years of the inception, sales of Orange increased by almost 200%. The products were becoming extremely popular. The company hired 120 employees to keep up with the demand and also added 10 different product lines of personal computers ranging from 10" monitor to a 24" monitor.<br/><br/><br/>
  <b>2.0 Reason to Replace The Present System</b><br/>
  Soon Tony realized that the original "small" system he had designed to keep track of the
sales and profits will not be sufficient to keep records of numerous sales/products. He
contacted, Alan Scott, the Vice President of R&D and gave the requirements to develop a
"Sales System" for the Company. <br/><br/><br/>
  <b>3.0 System Requirements</b><br/>
  3.1 Tony knew that the new system should be able to handle product line of 40 different products.<br/>
  3.2 System should accommodate 200 sales people and sales data of 30,000 customers.<br/>
  3.3 System should be accessible by his 11 warehouse clerks. <br/>
  3.4 Only Tony should be able to see monthly sales report. <br/><br/><br/>
  <b>4.0 Response Time</b><br/>
  Should have a quick response time.<br/><br/><br/>
  <b>5.0 Environment</b><br/>
  5.1 The new system was to run on IBM mainframe.<br/>
  5.2 The warehouse clerks had IBM PCs on their desks.<br/><br/><br/>
  <b>6.0 Reports</b><br/>
  Tony Carrasco also wanted several reports produced by the system which indicated:<br/>
  6.1 Monthly sale $ totals. <br/>
  6.2 Products that were sold. <br/>
  6.3 Which sales person sold the products, each sales person can see their report only but not other product reports sold by other sales people. <br/>
  6.4 Products that were returned. <br/><br/><br/>
  <b>7.0 Delivery TimeFrame</b><br/>
  Due to the New Year, Tony wanted to get the new system fully operational by end of
Dec. 2024. <br/><br/><br/>
  <b>8.0 General</b><br/>
  Tony Carrasco knew that his developers did not have enough time to develop and fully
test the Sales System. He decided to have his developers develop the system and planned
to hire his friends, Joe Blank, Mike Brosne and Jon Underwood for testing the system. <br/>
  You are hired as a consultant to assist in test planning and overall test process
improvement and you are asked to write a Systems Test Plan as your first assignment
with the Organization.<br/><br/><br/></p>
